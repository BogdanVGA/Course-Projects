Application designed to manage a set of surprises.

The final goal is to obtain a generic system capable of:
     use multiple surprise types (i.e. implement a common interface)
     implement various algorithms for storing and giving surprises
     use a random mechanism to generate a (new) set of surprises
     
Each surprise will implement a common interface -> ISurprise. The types of surprises are: fortune cookies, candies and minion toys.
 
The surprises will be stored in bags and each type of bag will implement a specific order to take out the susrprises contained in it: random, FIFO (queue) and LIFO (stack).

The bags will be created using a factory pattern. The BagFactory class implements a singleton.

For giving out surprises, the project implements an abstract class that is further extended to implement three specific options.
